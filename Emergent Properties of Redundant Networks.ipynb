    "# Emergent Properties of Redundant Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological neural networks have high degrees of redundancy and variable interconnectedness. These features remain mostly absent from the artificial networks (anns) that are used today in many prediction problems. The properties that emerge from multiple networks having varying degrees of interconnectedness and control over a system (like the heartbeat, breathing, etc) could be the basis of the human's ability to observe and define a \"self\" or what many call consciousness. I am curious about the emergent properties of anns when we set them up this way."
